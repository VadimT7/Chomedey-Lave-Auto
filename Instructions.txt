Instruction for Claude:
Build a full, multi-page professional website for a car wash + car detailing business. The site should be modern, attractive, fluid, and memorable, with an emphasis on before & after transformations, smooth animations, and brand consistency.

🌐 General Requirements:

Framework/Stack: Next.js + TailwindCSS (or any modern stack Claude prefers in Cursor).

Styling: Modern, clean, and smooth. Use glassmorphism, gradients, subtle reflections, and water/bubble elements.

Animations: GSAP or Framer Motion for buttery-smooth scroll and hover animations.

Theme: Fresh, clean, premium feel → water, soap bubbles, reflections, shine.

Mobile-first: Fully responsive, fast, and optimized.

Navigation: Sticky top navbar with subtle hover animations + smooth page transitions.

🏠 Pages & Content:
1. Home Page

✨ Animation & Interaction Ideas

Typography: Bold modern sans-serif (e.g., Poppins, Montserrat).

✅ Deliverables

Generate:

Full multi-page Next.js project with TailwindCSS and animations.

All sections + components reusable and easy to extend.

Clean, modular code with best practices.

⚡ Final Note for Claude:
The website should feel alive, fluid, and trustworthy. Visitors should be impressed instantly, smoothly discover services and transformations, and finally be nudged to visit/contact the car wash in real life.
